# My Coding Journey

This is my first repository on Github. 
I will dedicate my self to learning relevant programing lanuages to become a full stack developer. 
I am highly interested in technologies and the possibilites that come with it.
Initially, I will improve my knowlege of web development languages like HTML, CSS and JS.
